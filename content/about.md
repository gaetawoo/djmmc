### Who am I?

I am DJTennessee and Minecraft is my favorite game in the world!

### Why do I love Minecraft?

I love all the blocks there are to build with, all the crazy machines you can make with redstone, how you can do all this stuff with a friend, and lots more!

### Why did I make this page?

I want to help other people make all the cool creations that I know!
