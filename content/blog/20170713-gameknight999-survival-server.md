There is a fun online server called the _Gameknight999 Network_, and it has a survival server, which most people on the server play. It's really fun, and it also has a system called Grief Protection, which allows you to create land claims that protect your builds. If someone does however manage to ruin your builds, use `/report (player) (reason)` and maybe a Staff  Member will come to the rescue. Also, they will add a new survival server on July 15, 2017.

#### How to join the server:

 - Do Multiplayer on the title screen
 - Click on **Add Server**
 - Type in the address: **mc.gameknight999.com**

Now add the server! Once you join survival, type `/kit` to get started. Also, everyone is going to start saying "Welcome!", so you don't need to be afraid.
