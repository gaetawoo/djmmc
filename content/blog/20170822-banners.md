Ever thought of making some colorful banners for your castle or just wanted to decorate your shield? If you have a banner and some dye, then thats possible. All you will need for the banner is 6 **Wool** and a **Stick**. For decorating the banner, just use a **Banner** and some **Dye**.

#### Instructions:

1. On a crafting table, put the banner anywhere you want, as long as it doesen't get in the way of the dye.

2. Put the dye in any way you want, as long as every time you craft, you use only one color like this: put only red dye in a line; this will make a line appear on the banner when you craft, then you can put another line, but only use one color.

3. Keep decorating until the banner looks like the way you want it to look like. You can also use **Bricks**, **Vines**, **Golden Apple**, **Wither Skeleton Skull**, **Creeper Head**, **Oxeye Daisy**, and to make a copy i think you will need another **Banner**. Always use dye!

Now to try it out! Place the banner on a wall or on the floor. You can also craft banners with colored dye to change the background color of the banner. You can also walk through banners, and so can other mobs. You can also make a banner that looks like its telling you not to go somewhere, it has a big red X.
