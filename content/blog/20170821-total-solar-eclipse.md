I know this isn't minecraft, but today, on August 21, 2017, I saw a total solar eclipse with my very own eyes! It was also my very first eclipse! And I did not have to go far! It happened at home! Man was I lucky! ...and I also heard people outside.

#### What I saw:


1. It looked like the moon was on white fire.

2. The sun looked like a orange cookie that someone had taken a bite out of when I looked through my eclipse glasses.

3. It got cooler.

4. It got darker.

5. I saw Venus and I think I saw Mercury.

6. After and before totallity, I think I saw the diamond ring.

7. There were shadowbands.

8. There were little cresents on the floor.

9. I think I saw Bailey's Beads.

10. All the cicadas stoped buzzing.
