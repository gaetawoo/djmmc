Running out of water at that pond? I know how to make a infinite water supply that will last forever! All you will need are two **Water Buckets**.

#### Instructions:

1. Dig out a 2x2 hole, 1 block deep.

2. Place the water in the bottom-left and top-right or bottom-right and top-left.

Now to try it out! Get a bucket and take some water. The pool automaticly fills back up! Cool, isn't it? Sadly, this does not work on lava, so you can't have a infinite lava supply unless you know the command.
