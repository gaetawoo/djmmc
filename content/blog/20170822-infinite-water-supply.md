Running out of water at that pond? Or do you need to carry all that water to where you need it ithout running out when you collect it? I know how to make a infinite water supply that will last forever! All you will need are 2 **Water Buckets**.

<!--more-->

#### Instructions:

1. Dig out a 2x2 hole, 1 block deep.

2. Place the water in 2 opposite directions.

Now to try it out! get a bucket and take some water. The pool automaticly fills back up! Cool, isn't it? Sadly, this does not work on lava, so you can't have a infinite lava supply unless you can do the command.
