There are many kinds of items, but the Nether holds many rare ones. Here is a list of some nether items you can get, but beware; the mobs of the nether are very powerful.

<!--more-->

***Netherrack***: This probally won't be very hard to get. Just mine out the red floor in the nether with any kind of pick and you get netherrack. No matter how long you wait, fire doesen't automaticly put itself out on netherrack. Use this for fireplaces!

***Nether Brick***: Just cook up some netherrack and bam! You've got yourself some nether brick! Just so you know, the furnace won't actually make the bam. Craft 4 nether bricks to make a nether brick block.

***Glowstone***: Glowstone can be very high up the ceiling in the nether, so you will need to bring some blocks with you. Breaking a glowstone block gives you 3 or 4 glowstone dust. Craft the glowstone dust to make a glowstone block. You will need 4 dust to craft it. Glowstone is 1 block brighter that torches are, and the dust makes potions more powerful.

***Blaze Rod***: Get this from killing a blaze. Craft 1 blaze rod into blaze powder. Blaze powder fuels brewing stands and can be used to make Potions of Strength, while a blaze rod and 3 cobblestone makes a brewing stand. You cannot make potions without a trip to the nether!

***Ghast Tear***: Get this from killing a ghast. try to get the ghast to go over land so the tear doesen't fall into lava. Use the ghast tear to brew potions of regeneraton, and craft ender crystals.

***Nether Wart***: Find this at the stairs in a nether fortress. It only grows on soul sand, and water and sunlight aren't needed for it to grow. Bone meal won't work on it, but many potions cannot be brewed without nether wart.

***Wither Skull***: Get this rare item from killing a wither skeleton. Use three of these to summon the Wither.

***Soul Sand***: Four of this will summon the Wither, and use soul sand to grow nether wart. It can also make silverfish suffocate,
