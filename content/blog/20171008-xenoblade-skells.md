Skells are pretty useful in battle. They're powerful, huge, and they can even fly! But you don't just get these super-strong robots for free. This post will tell you how to get them.

<!--more-->

First, you will need to finish Chapter 6, then go to the BLADE barracks where you will find Vandham. talk to him to start the The Skell Licence mission.

To complete the mission, there are 8 missions you need to complete first, one for each division.

Better research probes will get you more revenue, and for the Curator challenge,  you can find the squashes in the area above King Falls.

For the rock armadillos, search in south Noctilum. Near a cave in that location is where I found most armadillos. I think sleeping will make the items respawn.

Then, in Primordia, I found the ladybugs by teleporting somewhere in the east and then collecting all the diamonds in sight, and it was nighttime when I found them.

For the Mediators challenge, to get on the ma-non ship, there is a warp pad near the tower in the adminstrative district, and it will take you to the ship.

The others I'm sure you can handle by yourself, the missions will tell you what to do.

Turn on the skell licence mission and use follow ball to get to the target. The reward for completing the mission is a Skell Licence and a free Skell!

So what happens when your skell breaks and you can't find it anymore? Just go to to the Customization Center in the BLADE barracks and do the bottom option (I don't remember what it's called) and select a skell. You can change and/or register your skells here, and when a skell is registered, it comes with you when you fast travel somewhere.

Then there is the Skell Flight Module. Finish Chapter 9 and go to the BLADE concourse. Use the terminal there and select the Flight module mission, the go to the target and accept the affinity mission there. Complete it to give all skells the ability to fly. This uses fuel though. Don't fly too much or you will fall and will have to refuel your skell with miranium to get it working again.

To buy a skell, go to Armory Alley, then do Skell Frames. Choose a skell that matches your level, from 30 to 50.

Fighting also uses fuel, and to refuel skells, go to the Customization Center in the barracks and do the bottom option again, select a skell, then do Refuel Skell. 5000 units of miranium will restore 3000 percent of the skell's fuel. Light skells can only have light skell gear, medium skells can equip light and medium skell gear, and heavy skells can carry light, medium, and heavy skell gear.

When your skell loses all its health, you will have to do the B thing with the shrinking orange circle and the huge white one. if you get a Perfect, you can get you skell back for free and you can continue the fight unharmed. if you get a good, you evacuate the skell unharmed but it will cost money to get it fixed. If you get a Failed, it will cost money to get the skell fixed, and you will come out with one health point left. When one of your party members' skell loses heath, he/she will automaticly get a Perfect.

Skells can use overdrive and arts too, and when fighting large enemies,  skells can bind them by pressing ZR and ZL at the same time, when it shows. Get all Perfects for maximum time.

If one party member is in a skell, all others' defense will boost up 20 percent. 2 skells, 40 defense. 3 skells, 60 defense.
