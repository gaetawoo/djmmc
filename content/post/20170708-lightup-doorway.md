I know a small contraption that even an arrow can activate! It requires any amount of the block of your choice, a **Redstone Lamp**, a **Lever** or **Button** (if you want an arrow to be able to activate it, use a Wooden Button), and any door of your choice. Also, iron doors need to receive a redstone signal in order to open; nothing else will open it.

#### Instructions:

![Lightup Doorway](/images/lightup_doorway.png)

1: Place the door anywhere you want; then place a redstone lamp on top of the door.

2: Place the Lever or Button on the lamp.

3: Surround the door with the block of your choice.

Now to try it out! Activate the Lever or Button. The redstone lamp will light up _and_ the door will open.

_**PS:** Using a bow and arrow to activate it seems like a waste but sometimes it can be pretty fun!_
