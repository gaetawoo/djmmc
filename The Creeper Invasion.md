                              The Creeper Invasion

####Chapter 1: Dinner

Alex was cooking some steak. Steve had gone mining in the Extreme Hills biome looking for emeralds. "Steve's chorus fruit farm has stopped working for the last few days, at least we solved the problem that kept them from growing," Alex said, talking to herself.

A few days ago, Steve's chorus fruit farm had mysteriously stopped working, so they had to harvest every single chorus flower and the trees, then started to rebuild the farm. They figured out the problem that day. It was because the Zombies had infected the plants, causing them to stop working.

Meanwhile, Steve was mining and thought to himself, "Tommorrow I'm opening the Jewel Shop. We could get lots of money," (Gold Nuggets were the money).

A half hour later, Steve came back home. Alex had prepared Chicken, Potatoes, Mushroom Stew, some Milk--and for dessert--Cookies and Cake.

"This looks delicious, Alex!"

"Thanks, Steve! I really worked hard on this meal." Alex served themselves some chicken and stew.

"Can you pass the potatoes, Alex?"

"Sure!"

Steve commented, "Mmmm, this is really good milk," as Alex served herself some more mushroom stew. Very soon everything was gone, except for the cake and cookies.

"Now for dessert," Alex said. Steve brought out the cake and cookies, and they both started to eat.

Steve, speaking with his mouth full, said "We should save some of this for Bones and Apples,". Bones was their dog and Apples was their cat. But before Alex could grab her last cookie, they heard something that sounded like 230 explosions.

"Whoa! What was that?!" Steve yelled, surprised by the explosion.

"I don't know, but we'd better investigate," Alex said, with a surprised face as well.

They both gasped in horror when they saw that Steve's chorus fruit farm was destroyed. "Oh no! I worked so hard on that farm!" Steve said.

"Now we might not be able to escape an army of monsters when we run out!" added Alex.

Then Steve noticed something on the ground. "Gunpowder..." He looked around for any ghast tears but there were none. Besides, ghasts couldn't just explode themselves for no reason like a creeper could.

"Creepers did this!" Steve exclaimed.

"You mean creepers blew up your farm?"

"I think so."

Bones and Apples came out through a small trapdoor in a hole in the house and looked at the gunpowder. Apples hissed at the thought of creepers destroying Steve's farm.

Bones wanted to avenge Steve's farm and kill every creeper he found, but he knew that wouldn't solve anything.

A creeper silently walked up to Bones and started to detonate.

"Bones! Move!" Steve screamed. Luckily, Bones was able to move at the right time before the creeper blew up.

_Kaboom!_

"That was close," Alex sighed after the creeper blew up.

A pile of gunpowder sat in the spot where the creeper had exploded. Apples started sniffing at the ground. The group followed Apples and her nose as Apples kept smelling that familiar scent.

When they reached the destination, Apples meowed at Bones to start digging. When they both reached stone, Alex and Steve took out their pickaxes and started mining. They were amazed by what they had found.

####Chapter 2: The Creeper Hive

"Wow Alex! It's a creeper hive!"

"Maybe there is treasure!"

Steve knew that creeper hives were made from thousands of connected underground tunnels and rooms.

Steve said "Wait Alex. There could be a million creepers down there. It would be very foolish to just go down with trillions of explosive monsters waiting to blow you up."

The two, along with their pets, climbed down into the hole. Apples started to hiss.

"Oh no! Creepers are nearby!" Steve was right. Six creepers were walking down the tunnel they were in. "Quick, mine into the wall and wait for the creepers to pass," he whispered quietly so the creepers would not hear him.

Steve waited ten seconds before daring to mine out of the wall. Unfortunately, ten seconds wasn't enough time and Steve broke through too soon.

The creepers were looking right at them.

"We've been spotted!" Alex yelled. The creepers started to follow them, as more and more creepers heard the alarm and joined the army.

Alex said "I have an idea!" She pulled out some TNT and arrows and started crafting. When she was done, she handed Steve some arrows with TNT stuck in the shafts.

They both fired a single arrow, since the explosion would be enough to kill the whole army.

_Kaboom!_

They had destroyed the creeper army but in the process, the explosion had woken up some silverfish. Bones barked at the swarm as Steve yelled, "Silverfish!" They attacked and destroyed some silverfish, but the swarm was too big and forced them into a different room. Unexpectedly, piles of gravel fell down on the swarm and the silverfish were suffocated.

"That was close. We weren't even wearing armor!" Steve said.

"I know, but I just like how my normal clothes feel. I don't like how the hard armor feels, although it can be very handy in battle."

"Next time, we should bring some Blast Protection IV armor with us before entering creeper-infested areas."

They started to look for a way out when they both gasped in surprise. "Treasure!" they shouted. They were standing in front of fifty large chests. But their good fortune was short-lived.

"Invaders!" a creeper yelled. Soon forty creepers trapped them in the treasure room.

Apples hissed. Thanks to her, the creepers backed away except for one that stood in front. Alex noticed something. The creeper was a charged creeper, with its explosion was twice as powerful as a normal one.

"Invaders are not allowed in here! Take any of that treasure and I will destroy you," it warned them.

Alex took a peek in a chest. There were piles of enchanted diamond gear and some nametags. She mined out the chest and it and its loot popped into her inventory.

"That's it!" the creeper said.

It started to detonate itself and jumped toward Alex. She hit it very hard with her sword and sent it flying toward the ceiling.

_KABOOM!!!_

The charged creeper exploded and the ceiling started to fall apart.

"Quick! Take the loot and the chests!" Steve yelled.

They took the chests and their loot and pushed their way through the creepers. They tried to detonate but were crushed by the crumbling ceiling that collapsed on them.

"We should get all the gunpowder that the creepers dropped."

They mined through the stone that buried the creepers and quickly collected all the gunpowder.

"This could be used for making TNT," said Alex.

"We should head back home for bed," Steve suggested.

They mined through the stone ceiling until they were on the surface. They were far from home and stranded on a grassy plain at nighttime during a rainstorm.

####Chapter 3: Finding Home

"Are we lost?" Steve said.

"I think so," Alex said.

"Apples, can you sniff the way back home?" Steve said.

Apples tried sniffing, and they ended up going around in circles.

Bones tried sniffing, but all he could smell was dirt and grass.

"This won't work," Steve said. "But maybe we could mine for redstone and iron, then we could make a compass to get home."

Alex said "But first, we need to build a shelter so we can be safe.".

Steve found some oak trees. He mined the wood and made a crafting table. He made tools out of wood while Alex crafted a small shelter.

"Ugh, this rain! I wish i had my rainhat on!" Steve said, annoyed by the rain.

"Don't worry, we won't have to be soaked by the rain after the shelter is finished." Alex said.

Soon their tummies were grumbling.

"Ohhh, im sooo hungry! I wish we had a lifetime supply of carrots!" Steve said. "I know, im so hungry i could eat 20 whole watermelons!" Alex replied.

Alex spotted something red under the first tree that Steve mined here.

"Its an apple!" Alex said.

"But its only one." Steve said.

"We can share it. You will have one half, and i will have the other half." Alex said.

Steve said "Don't forget about Bones and Apples, they need to be fed too, you know."

"Then i'll cut the apple into forths," Alex replied.

Soon the apple was gone.

"My tummy is still rumbling, but not as much anymore." Steve said.

"Mine too," Alex said.

Bones barked and Apples meowed.

"Im tired..." Alex said.

"But we can't sleep on the hard wood... i... don't... like it... too... hard..." Steve said and yawned.

"too.... hard..... to sleep... on......." Alex said before she closed her eyes. Steve did the same. Bones and Apples curled up and slept on the floor.

Even with Apples with them, they didn't notice that a creeper had snuck into their shelter.

_Kaboom!_

The next day, when they all woke up, they were surprised at what happened.

They were zooming _over_ the clouds. But how?

Steve and Alex remembered hearing a explosion in their sleep.

"Maybe thats why we're in the sky." Steve said.

"Could be," Alex replied.

"A beacon!" Steve exclaimed.

"Thats where home is!" Alex said.

But instead of landing home, the beacon was in a desert village.

"Ack! why is it suddenly getting so hot?!" Alex said.

"Phew, i think we landed in a desert."

_Crash!_

"Ugh, i don't feel so good..." Steve said.

"Me neither..." Alex said.

Just then, a villager greeted them.

"Hi! My name is Butcher. Would you like to trade something for a bit of meat?"

Alex replied, "Ugh... By the way we are feeling now, i'd say a _lot_ of meat."

Butcher said, "Ok, then. 2 emeralds for 50 cooked chickens.".

Steve gave him 2 emeralds and Butcher gave them the chicken.

"Oh wait, we haven't even introduced ourselves yet." Steve said.

"im Alex." Alex said.

"Im Steve." Steve said.

"This is Bones, our dog." Steve said.

"And this is Apples, our cat." Alex said.

"Hi, nice to meet you Steve, Alex, Bones and Apples." Butcher said.

Butcher said "Its very wierd how you four could just fall from the sky onto our village,".

Steve replied "It was a creeper who did that.".

"A creeper?! They've been saying that creepers are blowing everything up in the Overworld!" Butcher said.

"But only on this server, if they spread the damage to other servers, this could have been a lot worse." Steve said.

"Oh! Do you know anyone who trades comapsses?" Alex said.

"Sure, i think Cartographer does." Butcher said.

Steve replied "Do you think its ok if we build a minecart tunnel leading from your village to our home?"

"Sure, as long as it helps you." Butcher replied. He told everyone in the village about the minecart rail and took the group to Cartographer.

####Chapter 4: The Minecart Tunnel

"Sure, i have a compass. In fact, i have five stacks of them!" Cartographer said.

"Great, we'll need just one of them." Alex said.

"We will also need all the rails we can get," Steve added.

They started to mine down and then follow the compass and dig as the villagers placed rails behind them.

Then the compass started pointing backward.

"We are here!" Alex exclaimed.

They began to dig upward.

They all gasped in extreme horror.

"Our home!!!" Steve said, "Its gone!!!".

"We worked way harder on that!" Alex said.

They both fainted.

"Oh no! What happened to their home?" one of the villagers said.

"Oh, will they be ok?' another said.

"I hope so,".

"We need to call Healer!".

"But he's back at the village! How are we ever going to get to him now?"

A villager pointed at the rails and held a minecart.

"I know what you're thinking!"

The villagers took steve and Alex in the minecarts and took them to Healer while Bones and Apples waited.

"There he is!" a villager said after they reached the village.

"We should hurry up, the sun is setting."

"Healer! We need you! Now!"

"Whats the proble- oooh, i see." Healer said.

They went into Healer's home.

"Hmm... They look like they fainted."

"Do you think we should slap them?" a vllager suggested.

"But if we do, that dog of theirs is gonna kill us all!".

"Maybe we can get help," another villager suggested.

"We can build rails leading to other villages and see if they can help us!".

####Chapter 5: The Creeper Invasion

5 months have passed since Steve and Alex have fainted from the destruction of their castle, which was also their home.

Steve and Alex yawned.

"Uhhh... Alex?" Steve said.

"What is it?" Alex replied.

"I feel like we've been sleeping for the last few millineums," Steve said.

"Hey, look Alex! A door!" Steve said.

Steve opened the door.

They were inside a enormus room, filled with iron clad villagers. 

"I wonder whats going on," Alex said.

Suddenly, some sort of redstone machine gave them hyper enchanted  diamond gear and bow and a arrow, since the bow had the enchantment _Infinity I_.

"I think there is a battle going on out there," Steve said.

The room was made out of stone bricks. It was daytime, and there were glass windows.

Bones and Apples apearred beside them.

"Bones!" Steve said.

"Apples!" Alex said.

"Oh, its so good to see you guys!" they both said.

The group walked out the front door.

Trillions and trillions of creepers were fighting against the villagers.

Butcher came and said "Steve! Alex! Its so good to see you again!"

"Hi, Butcher!" they both said.

The group  found themselves facing a large wall with thousands of villagers firing arrows down at creepers.

"What happened?" Alex asked Butcher.

Butcher said "Millions of creepers started attacking, so we had to fight back."

Bones knew this was the perfect time to avenge Steve's chorus fruit farm.

Hundreds of other tamed wolves joined Bones and tore at the creepers.

They tried to detnonate, but Apples and other cats scared them enough to halt the detonation process.

Steve and Alex joined in battle as Butcher continued firing arrows at the mottled creatures.

Steve had an idea.

"Alex, are you thinking what im thinking?".

Alex said "You have a plan don't you?"

They went over the plan.

Steve shot a flaming arrow at a creeper. It started to detonate.

"Back everyone, Back!" Alex yelled.

"FOR MINECRAFT!" the villagers yelled.

Zillions and zillions and zillions of explosions boomed across the land.

Every single creeper in the fight was destroyed.

"We did it! Finally!" the villagers exclaimed.

The village crafter walked up to Steve and Alex and said "Steve, Alex, this castle is your new home."

"Oh, thank you very much!" Alex said.

"Thank you, we really appreciate it!" Steve said.

####Chapter 6: Celebration

"Thanks for opening the Jewel Shop for me and giving us the money you got." Steve said.

"Our pleasure," The crafter said.

All the villagers brought food and drinks for the celebration.

"But why did you yell "FOR MINECRAFT!" after Steve blew up all the creepers?" Alex asked.

Butcher said "Because we battled the creepers for thirty months after you fainted.".

They went into a large room made of gold.

"You mined all that gold to make this room? Just for us? Thank you!" Steve and Alex said.

Steve had an idea.

"I know! Lets take this party to the Gameknight999 Network!"

They took the digital road in their digital car and drove to the Gameknight999 Network.

"Lets go tooooo... Paintball!" Alex suggested.

They went in the Paintball portal.

Monkeypants_271 was there.

About 50 players were playing Paintball, including DJTennessee, NenaPump and Goxx.

They typed in chat.

"Hi Steve and Alex!" DJTennessee said.

"Monkeypants_271 is in Paintball!" Goxx added.

"Hi everyone!" NenaPump said.

They all played paintball while having drinks and snacks.

A user named MCLove123 took a cold drink, which was just a water bottle named on an anvil.

A MVP+ user named Pizzative got 6 breads.

A couple minuites later, Gameknight999 came on the server.

Everyone had fun till Gameknight and Monkeypants left.

"I think we're done..." Steve said.

"We should head back to our own server." Alex said.

They all said bye as Alex, Steve and the villagers left the server.

"That was fun." Alex said.

"I want to do that again!" Steve said.

_Kaboom!_

"What was that?" a villager said.

"I don't know, but im sure the battle isn't over yet." another one said.

And they were right.

####Chapter 7: Mystery Solved on coal in one of the small rooms.

"Hmmmmmmmm......." he said again, this time for longer.

"I think now i know why." he said.

"It's because more creepers are being born into the hive and they eat coal to grow stronger." Steve said.

"Oooohhh." Alex said.

"I wondered, maybe we can get them to join our side." Steve said.

"I think we can." Alex said.

"Lets tell the villagers." Steve suggested.

They went to the village.

"Hey everyone! We think we can get the creepers to join our side!" Alex said.

the bully laughed very hard.

"Ha ha ha ha ha! Your apples aren't gone! I fed them to my dog, he's still eating them!".

He laughed again.

All the villagers stared angrilly at him.

A villager child who was fishing accedentally missed the fish that he fished out.

The fish smacked the bully in the face.

Everyone gasped. They knew what happened if you did something to a bully that he doesen't like, like getting hit in the face by a fish, things woudn't end well for you.

The bully grabed the child by the shirt.

"This is going to hurt." the bully said.

"But i didn't do anything to you!" the child said.

"Yes you did! You threw a fish at my face! A fish! At my face! at MY face!"

"But it was a accedent! I didn't throw the fish at you on purpose! In fact, i didn't throw a fish at all!'

"Well on purpose or an accedent, im going to hit you, and it's going to hurt really bad."

Just before the bully's fist could punch into the child's face, something wonderfull happened.

####Chapter 8: Blue Steve

BLAM!

The bully was knocked backward.

The villagers gasped again.

The bully tried to fight back, but was caught in some sort of rope.

"Leave him alone!" the stranger said.

"But he hit me!" the bully said.

"Well its better if you don't hit ANYBODY at all. In fact, i just called your mother." the stranger said.

"You did?!" the bully said.

The bully's mom came and opened the door when Blue Steve released the bully.

"To your room! Don't try to hurt or bully anyone else again!" she said.

"Ok mom..." the bully replied.

The bully went to his room.

"Thank you, you saved me." the child said.

"Your welcome. By the way, in case you haven't known, my name is Blue Steve." Blue Steve said.

"Hi, Blue Steve. Im Steve, This is Alex, Bones and Apples. Nice to meet you!" Steve said.

"Oh, and by the way, my sword is kinda fat, making it like a hammer." Blue Steve said.

"Hey Blue Steve, do you think we can get the creepers to join our side?" Alex said.

Blue Steve scoffed.

"I think everything's possible." he said.

"Oh, do you want to see my house? Blue Steve asked.

"Sure." Steve and Alex said.

"Oh, but i must warn you. My home is a abandoned mineshaft that we decorated a little, so you might get a bit lost." Blue Steve said.

""We"?" Steve said.

"I have a family, with my father zombie, skeleton mother, two spider kids, one girl, one boy, two cave spider babies, one girl, one boy and my pet bat, Flyglide." Blue Steve said.

"That's kind of a mouthful of words." Alex said.

"I did have a lot to say." Blue Steve replied.

They followed Blue Steve to his home.

"Wow! This is a very good place!" Alex said.

The place looked like a decorated mineshaft, with the paths leading to caves blocked, the whole place lit, every ore mined out, and signs pointing to rooms, and sometimes pointing to other signs.

They heard a zombie moan.

"Thats my father, he usually works with the anvil, enchanting and repairing swords and armor and all that repairable-and-enchantable-stuff-that-are-enchanted-without-commands stuff." Blue Steve said.

"That's kind of a mouthful of words." Alex said again.

"And just in case the house gets invaded, there are 5 super-extremeley well hidden secret exits that are almost impossible to find for a newcomer." Blue Steve said.

Blue Steve looked identical to Steve, exept it looked like Blue Steve had light blue swirls on the side of his face, kinda like tatoos.

"I like those swirls on your face, Blue Steve." Alex said.

"Thanks, my family decided to paint my face so i don't look exactly identical to Steve, who already exists." Blue Steve said.

"Good thing we can tell who's who, twin." Steve said.

"We are twins?" Blue Steve said.

"Yeah, we were identical till your parents painted your face." Steve said.

"Anyway, lets go mining so we have resources when we need to reform the creepers." Blue Steve said.

Then the group went mining, while Blue steve told his family about the plan.

####Chapter 9: Mining

"So we are going to reform the creepers, huh?" Blue Steve's father said.

"Im sure that'll be easy, once we get the resources." Blue Steve's mother said.

They got their picks and joined Steve and Alex.

"So your family decided to join us?" Alex said.

"Uh-huh." Blue Steve said.
